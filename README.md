# Next.js Dynamic Route Data Fetching Error: Handling Missing Data

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in Next.js applications involving dynamic routes and data fetching using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.  The issue arises when the data fetched from an external source (e.g., database, API) is missing or contains unexpected values, leading to runtime errors during rendering.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where we attempt to access properties that might not exist in the fetched data. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to implement robust error handling to mitigate this issue and prevent unexpected crashes.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone ...`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage

Observe the behavior of the buggy code in `bug.js` and compare it with the improved error handling approach provided in `bugSolution.js`.  Experiment with different data scenarios (data missing or invalid) to fully grasp the issue and solution.
