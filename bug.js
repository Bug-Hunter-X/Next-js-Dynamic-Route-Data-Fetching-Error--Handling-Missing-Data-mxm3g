In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getStaticProps or getServerSideProps) with dynamic routes and improper data fetching.  If you don't handle missing or invalid data gracefully, it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  This often manifests as an error during the rendering phase, especially if you're trying to access a property that isn't present in the data received from your data source (e.g., database or API).
